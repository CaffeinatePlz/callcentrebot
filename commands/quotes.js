    "[Rejection] gets less hard, not not hard.",
    "And sometimes it's not outright rejection. People joke about \"it's not you it's me\" being a fake excuse, but sometimes it's a legit thing. And if you're open and honest with them, and they're kind people with decent communication skills, you'll know which. And it's okay to feel sad about it too. Because if someone for whatever reason isn't in a place to be in a relationship with you, them saying yes anyway would be worse for both of you. And maybe both people feel sad about it. That's a thing.",

    "Pain and difficulty are temporary. But they shape you into a stronger person, and the things that stronger you does, that better others, propagate on through others into the far future",
    "Use your anger, don't let your anger use you. If it's worth fighting, by all means have at it. But if the gains aren't worth the stress, anxiety, and frustration, take a deep breath and let it go.",
    "I think everyone has that instinct, to hide and be afraid, tbh. I used to be quiet and timid because I let it rule me, but in one area after another, I've learned to tell it no, bad instinct and be fearless. I hope one day I can defeat it everywhere.",
    "\"be extra cautious around tools you're not familiar with\" seems like a great rule of thumb if you want to keep both of your thumbs.",
    "A water game with no water would be the most-troll teaser ever. Like a short video with clips of kids on a boat, then the game logo FIRST  Seaworthy. Chief Delphi would actually explode.",
    "I think of it this way -- there are a lot of people , and just like physical characteristics, mental characteristics have a lot of individual variation.  Naturally, that means there will be a lot of people with different sets of experience. Add to that, that labels are basically a way of simplifying all of that variation down to a small number of words to describe one's own experience.. and it's inevitably going to be confusing to anyone, whether they're experiencing it or not.",

    "There are good things about community colleges. There are good things about ivies. Those are obviously very different qualities. Heck, there are good things about trade schools.

    "\"major in something useful you like, and something you love\" is a good strategy.",
    "Don't be a workaholic.",
    "I think the best way to maximize people's potential is to show them that they can. I mean, there are so many people who just see hopelessness... [we need] to show them that glimmer of hope.",
    "Uh, finding a girlfriend is hard. Dw about it and just focus on being awesome.",
    "Don't fear what you don't know, or aren't good at; embrace it. That's the place where you learn the most.",
    "Apply. What's the worst that happens, they tell you no?",
    "A lot of things in academics are not about intelligence, but rule following. And it's a shame, because being taught to follow rules can be fine, but knowing how and when not to follow them is a valuable thing educated out of too many people.",
    "I would expect someone really really good at following rules to be less successful than someone who knows how, but critically when, to play the game. Do your best, but always be skeptical, especially of what the scores, and success metrics others give you really mean.",
    "Everyone around you is getting better. You really do need to run to stay in place.",
